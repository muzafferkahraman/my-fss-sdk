# my-fss-sdk

I set out to simplify the API coding process for FSS. This project is still ongoing and I'm adding new APIs whenever I find the opportunity.
Instead of dealing with a more comprehensive API using the requests library, I aimed to abstract the process into concise and understandable methods.
ie to get a list of regions
